Requirements to build LicenseManager:
- VisualStudio 2012
- .NET 4

To start using licenses, instantiate a license manager and call LoadLicense on the path. This will give you a license file to use, 
call IsValid with the name of the attribute to see if it's valid. At this stage, only JSON licenses are supported, but I'm going to implement
a signed file next before I get to work on the manager UI
